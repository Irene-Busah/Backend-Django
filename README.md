# Backend-Django
This repository keeps track of all my learning and projects on Django Backend framework and Django Rest Framework for API development. Inside each folder comprises of trial projects to test my understanding and real time project I created on my own. Let's discuss some of the projects in this repository

## 1. StudyBud
StudyBud is a simple platform to converge people with common interest to learn together. The application enables users to sign up and login to their account. The homepage shows rooms created by people to with a title describing what they are talking about in that room. Users will also be able to create their rooms for other people to join and discuss or learning through a simple exchange of messages in the room. 
This project was inspired by a tutorial I was following to bring together every knowledge I have gained in learning Django Backend framework. Feel free to trial it(README inside the folder with instructions)

## 2. Little Lemon Restaurant Web Application
This is a restaurant application to enable their clients view their menus and book a space in the restaurant. Users can sign up or login to their account to make bookings for the restaurant to reserve their seats. It is not complete yet!! Some features like authentication needs to be configured well set right permissions to users, which I am still working to complete it.

## 3. Django To-Do Application
This is a simple todo application which can used to schedule all your activities within a period of time. Users needs to create an account or login to their space to be able to add tasks on their space. When a task is completed, you can mark it complete, of which you can mark incomplete when you realize it isn't complete yet. You can edit the tasks you have added and delete tasks. The application sends an email notification to the user once a task is added, edited or overdued.

## 4. Personal Expense Tracker(MyWallet)
This application aims to assist users track their expenses. Users should be able add their expenses & transactions(withdraw, deposit & transfer). The transaction and expenses added help the application calculate their total expenses and balance in their account. The application will also display a graph of their expenses and the category in which their expenses are. The frontend of the application is complete. Still working on the backend!!
